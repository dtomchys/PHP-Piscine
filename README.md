# PHP-Piscine
This is the intensive PHP course, which gives basic knowledge in the WEB sphere.
Every directory is one day tasks I did, but RUSH00 and RUSH01.For these two tasks I had two days.
1. d00 - HTML/CSS
2. d01 - loops;if/else; variables
3. d02 - using more complicated standart functions
4. d03 - MAMP; GET/POST; basic HTML requests
5. d04 - super global arrays; basic realisation of validation and loggin in
6. RUSH00 - a basic non-MVC realisation of web-site(very basic and after all it had been done
with a very few knowledge for two days)
7. d05 - MYSQL
8. d06 - that was very complicated stuff I couldn't do but the first task: Color class
9. d07 - OOP(Exact inheritance). j07 is tests to my tasks.
10 RUSH01 - that was supposed to be some interactive game, 
but the subject was so difficult and overweighted to have been done so I did a little to validate it.
